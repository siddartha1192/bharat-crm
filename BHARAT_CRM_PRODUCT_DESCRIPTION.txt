                      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

26. COMMON QUESTIONS
--------------------

Q: How does the WhatsApp integration work?
A: Bharat CRM integrates with WhatsApp Business API (provided by Meta). You need to set up a WhatsApp Business account, get API credentials from Meta Business Suite, configure them in the CRM, and then you can send/receive WhatsApp messages directly from the CRM interface. The AI can automatically respond to customer queries using your knowledge base.

Q: What AI features are included?
A: The CRM includes two AI assistants: (1) Portal AI for querying your CRM data via chat, and (2) WhatsApp AI for auto-responding to customer messages. The AI uses your uploaded knowledge base (product docs, FAQs) to provide accurate answers. It can also automatically create tasks, appointments, and leads based on WhatsApp conversations.

Q: How do I upload my product information for the AI?
A: Go to Settings → Vector Database, upload your product documentation (TXT, PDF, DOC files up to 50MB), and click "Run Ingest Process". The AI will process these documents and use them to answer customer questions on WhatsApp.

Q: Can I customize the automation rules?
A: Yes! You can create custom automation rules for different triggers (Lead Created, Stage Changed, etc.). You can write your own HTML email templates with variables like {{name}}, {{company}}, {{stage}}, or use the provided professional templates.

Q: Is my data secure?
A: Yes, the CRM uses industry-standard security practices including JWT authentication, encrypted passwords (bcrypt), HTTPS encryption, role-based access control, and SQL injection prevention. Your data is isolated in a multi-tenant architecture.

Q: Can I integrate with my existing tools?
A: Yes, the CRM provides a complete REST API that you can use to integrate with other tools. It also has native integrations with Gmail, Google Calendar, and WhatsApp Business API.

Q: How many users can I have?
A: Unlimited users. You can add as many team members as needed and organize them into departments and teams with role-based permissions.

Q: Does it work on mobile devices?
A: Yes, the CRM is fully responsive and works on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. You can manage your business on the go.

Q: Can I export my data?
A: Yes, you can export contacts, leads, and other data. The CRM also provides API access to your data for custom integrations.

Q: What happens if I delete a conversation?
A: Conversations and messages are stored in both the database and file system. When you delete a conversation from the UI, it's removed from the database but backup exists in files. You can start fresh conversations anytime.

Q: How does the AI know which task to create?
A: The AI analyzes the WhatsApp message using natural language processing, identifies the user's intent (e.g., "create a task", "schedule a demo", "I'm interested in your product"), extracts relevant information (title, date, name, email), and creates the appropriate entity in the CRM automatically.

Q: Can I disable AI for specific conversations?
A: Yes, each WhatsApp conversation has an AI toggle. You can enable or disable the AI assistant on a per-conversation basis, allowing you to manually handle certain chats while automating others.

Q: How accurate is the AI?
A: The AI provides a confidence score with each response (0-1). Responses with confidence above 0.7 are generally accurate. The AI is trained on your uploaded knowledge base, so accuracy improves as you add more comprehensive product documentation.

Q: What file formats can I upload to the knowledge base?
A: You can upload TXT, PDF, DOC, DOCX, and MD (Markdown) files up to 50MB each. The system automatically processes these files, splits them into chunks, and creates embeddings for semantic search.

Q: How long does it take to process uploaded documents?
A: The ingest process runs in the background and typically takes 1-5 minutes depending on the file size and number of documents. You'll see a success notification when it's complete.

Q: Can I use my own WhatsApp number?
A: No, you need to use WhatsApp Business API which provides a dedicated business phone number through Meta. Personal WhatsApp numbers cannot be used with the Business API.

Q: Is there a mobile app?
A: Currently, the CRM is a web application that works on mobile browsers. A dedicated mobile app may be developed in the future.

Q: Can I white-label the CRM?
A: Yes, the CRM can be white-labeled with your company branding, logo, and color scheme. Contact your developer for customization.

Q: How do I get started?
A: (1) Set up the backend and database, (2) Configure environment variables (Gmail, WhatsApp, OpenAI), (3) Create your admin account, (4) Upload product knowledge base, (5) Add your team members, (6) Start adding contacts and leads, (7) Enable WhatsApp integration to start communicating with customers!
